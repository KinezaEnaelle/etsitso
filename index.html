          <h1>Factors behind a marketing campaign sucess</h1>
          <p>
            A successful marketing campaign depends on a number of factors, both
            on the side of the agency and on the side of the client company.
            Whether you are on one side or the other, from the moment you
            execute a campaign the responsibility for success falls on both of
            you. <br />
            Some of the factors affecting campaigns may be beyond your control
            but, without doubt, others are totally manageable. Based on our
            experience, we've put together 5 key elements among others that you
            should consider for every marketing campaign, to maximize your
            chances of success.<br />
            <span>1.</span>Clearly stating the scope of the work and
            expectations from both parties: It is possible that due to various
            factors a marketing campaign essentials steps to launch such as the
            briefing are rushed. That’s a bad start. A recipe for an ineffective
            campaign. It is fundamental to resist the pressure to launch and do
            things the right way. Blurry expectations are an open ground to
            disagreements between the two parties. <br />
            <span>2.</span>Effective communication and collaboration: One
            cannot highlight enough the importance of effective communication
            and collaboration. For a better collaboration, it is essential to
            have an understanding of individual roles. Each part should know
            clearly from the on-set expected deliverable tasks and mid/long term
            goals. This enables highlighting critical tasks to not miss and
            avoiding ineffectiveness. For the communication side, constant
            in-person and online dialogue is very important. Multiple
            communication options and channels must be put in place. This is
            fundamental to encourage feedback and foster an environment of
            trust. Fluid communication ultimately boosts progress in tasks
            execution. Thirdly, conflict will surely arise. Even when you
            execute planned tasks effectively, issues and misunderstandings will
            arise. Better prepare for such situation by laying down conflict
            resolutions strategies. Win-Win scenarios are key to resolve these
            situations.<br />
            <span>3.</span>Thorough mapping of the actions end-result allowing
            flexibility in execution: When executing ground activities, there
            are always unexpected situations where teams have to adjust. Having
            already defined campaigns goals allows to adapt to field execution
            challenges without compromising the end goal. Both parties need to
            be flexible to adjust to new realities keeping in mind expected
            actions outcomes.<br />
            <span>4.</span>Creativity conducive work environment: It is crucial
            to set up a work environment where creative agencies feel free to
            express their creativity and enrich the campaigns sometimes
            on-the-go. Project champions need to keep an open door attitude
            toward new concepts provide they fit in schedule and serve project
            ultimate purpose.<br />
            <span>5.</span>Openness to Out-of-Box creative concepts: One of the
            character trait of creative marketing teams is their bubbling
            creative mind. You’re guaranteed to never get bored. While executing
            campaigns, it is much expected that new creative concepts emerge.
            Probing such ideas and encouraging them make your campaign go a long
            way. <br />
